React in strict mode executes every function twice to see if the code runs fine.

When the value of the key prop, added to a component change, the component will be recreated.
Key props also helps React to identify elements, per example in a loop.

A useRef can be used to connect an HTML element, but it can also be used to store a value which not change when the component function is executed again.
